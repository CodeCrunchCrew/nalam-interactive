              Founded in Germany in 2014, and launched in the USA in 2023, NALAM was the result of
              Ute Kellerâ€™s transformative visit to India, where she was moved by the pressing needs
              she saw. Our accomplishments today owe to the generosity of our donors and the
              unwavering dedication of our local partners.
            </p>
            <p className="fs-5">
              NALAM empowers vulnerable girls in South India through nutrition, security, shelter,
              healthcare, education, and skills training. Our volunteer-powered organization
              provides care and opportunities to orphaned, destitute, and half-orphan girls, aiming
              to uplift them out of poverty. We believe educated, empowered girls can transform
              their lives and break cycles of hardship.
